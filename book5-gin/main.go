//I recommend that you start off using go vet as a required part of your automated build process and golint as part of your code review process (since golint might have false positives and false negatives, you canâ€™t require your team to fix every issue it reports). Once you are used to their recommendations, try out golangci-lint and tweak its settings until it works for your team.
